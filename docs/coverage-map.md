# Coverage Map

The declared scope and the oracle-verified status of each area. The target is
**MATLAB-executable undergraduate and graduate *applied/computational* mathematics**
— not proof-based pure math (see "Out of scope" below). Coverage is measured by
tagged oracle cases (`matlab/test/oracle/cases.ts`); run the report with:

```bash
pnpm oracle:coverage
```

**Status (as of this revision):** 793 tests green · 658 MATLAB oracle fixtures ·
658/658 cases classified across 22 domains.

`✓` = oracle-verified against real MATLAB · `~` = partial · (blank) = not yet.

## Out of scope (wrong abstraction for a MATLAB sandbox)

Proof-based pure mathematics is **not** "run a script, compare output" and is a
non-target: abstract algebra, topology, measure theory, functional analysis as
theorem-proving, category theory, logic/model theory, algebraic geometry beyond
symbolic polynomial examples. These need theorem statements and proof checking,
not numeric/CAS execution parity.

**Scope statement:** *100% coverage of declared graduate computational-math
workflows — not 100% of all graduate mathematics.*

## Backlog status

The backlog is bucketed so it does not accidentally reintroduce MATLAB-clone
ambitions. The computational contract is the target; runtime/IO breadth is not.

### Required

None currently.

The previous proposed gaps were rechecked against MATLAB R2026a and the sandbox
registry. They were either already implemented, intentionally out of scope, or
not MATLAB function names.

- `khatriRao`: not a MATLAB R2026a function (`exist("khatriRao") == 0`). Do not
  implement as part of MATLAB-compatible coverage.
- `gammapdf`: incorrect name. MATLAB uses `gampdf`, which is already implemented
  and oracle-validated.
- `wronskian`: not a MATLAB R2026a function (`exist("wronskian") == 0`; calling it
  errors). The engine's "undefined function" already matches MATLAB — do not
  implement it as MATLAB-compatible coverage.

Recently closed (multi-output forms now implemented + oracle-validated):
`[p,S,mu] = polyfit` (centered/scaled), `[L,U,P,Q] = lu` (sparse, `P*A*Q = L*U`),
`diag` of a symbolic matrix (extract + construct), symbolic polynomial `gcd`.

### Validate existing (implemented + oracle-validated)
All oracle-validated — no validation backlog remains:
- **Decompositions / matrix functions:** `eig`/`svd`/`qr`/`lu`/`chol`,
  `schur`/`hess`/`polyeig`, `expm`/`sqrtm`/`logm`, `pinv`/`rank`/`null`/`orth`/`rref`/`cond`
- **Iterative / sparse solvers:** `gmres`/`minres`/`bicg`/`bicgstab`/`lsqr`, `eigs`/`svds`
- **ODE:** `ode45`/`ode23`/`ode113`/`ode15s`/`deval`
- **Optimization:** `fminbnd`/`fminsearch`/`fsolve`/`quadprog`/`lsqlin`/`linprog`
- **Approximation:** `interp2`/`interpn`/`ppval`/`makima`/`polyvalm`/`residue`
- **Fourier / signal:** `fft2`/`fftshift`/`hilbert`/`findpeaks`
- **Graph:** `shortestpath`/`conncomp`/`distances`/`toposort`/`centrality`/`maxflow`/`minspantree`
- **Statistics:** distribution `*pdf`/`*cdf`/`icdf`, `var`/`std`/`corrcoef`/`cov`
- **Symbolic CAS:** `jacobian`/`hessian`/`taylor`/`laplace`/`dsolve`/`vpasolve`

Functions with non-unique outputs are validated by invariants rather than raw
value equality (e.g. `linprog` objective value, `residue` sorted poles, `eig`
reconstruction residual, `svd`/`qr` sign conventions, graph path length).

### Inferential statistics / unsupervised ML (implemented + oracle-validated)
Hypothesis tests: `ttest`/`ttest2`, `kstest` (one-sample, exact Marsaglia–Tsang–Wang
+ Birnbaum–Tingey one-sided), `kstest2`, `vartest`, `chi2gof` (controlled
`Ctrs`/`Edges`+`Frequency`+`Expected`+`NParams` form; auto-binning default is
best-effort), `anova1`, `signrank`, `ranksum`. Clustering / projection:
`kmeans` (deterministic via `'Start'`), `pca` (validated on `latent`), `knnsearch`,
`pdist`. `chi2gof`'s raw-data auto-binning is **not** locked (MATLAB's default
binning is version-sensitive).

### Deferred (real, but only if course-driven)
Large model-object families (`fitlm`/`fitglm`/`fitcsvm`/`fitctree`/`fitrgp`),
full table/timetable ecosystem (`retime`/`synchronize`/`stack`/`unstack`),
`anova2`/`kruskalwallis`/`multcompare`.

### Out of scope (clone ambitions — explicitly not requirements)
- Language runtime: `classdef`, `arguments`, real `global`/`persistent`,
  `evalin`/`assignin`, path model (`addpath`/`rmpath`/`path`/`genpath`).
- I/O needing host APIs: `webread`/`webwrite`, `imread`/`imwrite`,
  `audioread`/`audiowrite`, `matfile`, `savefig`/`openfig`, `xmlread`.
- RNG output parity: `mvnrnd`/`bootstrp`/`datasample` and any exact
  random-output oracle comparison (`rng`-fixing won't reproduce MATLAB's stream).
- Proof-based pure mathematics (see above).

**Claim:** *validated graduate computational subset* — not MATLAB parity.
